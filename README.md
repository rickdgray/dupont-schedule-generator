# DuPont Schedule Generator

This project provides a simple tool to generate modified DuPont work schedules. The DuPont schedule is a rotating shift schedule that consists of four teams working in a 12-hour shift pattern over a four-week cycle. This schedule is commonly used in industries that require 24/7 coverage, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and emergency services. The modified schedule this tool generates includes an additional week in rotation called the "relief week," during which standard 9-to-5 shifts are assigned with weekends off.

Line 8 of the program dictates the first shift of the year. Afterwhich, the schedule generates in 5-week cycles.
